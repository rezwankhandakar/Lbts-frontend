/**
 * Page ranges over one source PDF, as pure arithmetic.
 *
 * A challan is a slice of the WhatsApp file — pages 3 to 5 of 24 — and every
 * interesting rule about that slice is a statement about integers: it has to
 * be inside the document, it has to run forwards, and it must not claim pages
 * another challan already took. None of that needs a database or a PDF, so
 * none of it is written where a database or a PDF is in the way.
 *
 * This file mirrors `LBTS-Backend/src/modules/challan/lib/page-ranges.ts` rule
 * for rule — change one, change both. It exists here so the workspace can say
 * "pages 3–5 overlap LBTS-CH-2026-000004" while somebody is still dragging the
 * selector, rather than after a round trip. The server runs the same rules
 * against what is actually on record, and that is the check that decides.
 *
 * It imports nothing, deliberately. The frontend test runner is `node --test`
 * over TypeScript with the types stripped, which resolves modules the way Node
 * does — so a file that is worth testing on its own is a file with no imports
 * to resolve. The two limits below are declared here rather than in
 * `../types`, which re-exports them, for exactly that reason.
